## Game Description

The game is a demo inspired by Ice Tower, where the player climbs a series of blocks while the tower collapses beneath them. The goal is to survive as long as possible and reach the finish line before the floor disappears. Throughout the game, special items appear that grant the player temporary abilities-such as stronger or weaker jumps-that influence gameplay style and strategy.

The game combines fast movement, quick reactions, and dealing with constantly falling platforms, requiring the player to be agile and precise with their jumps.
